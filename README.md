# learning-go

This repo contains learning experiments in Go. 


## Requirements

1. `go` available in cmd

For a good time:

1. Install Air

    `go install github.com/air-verse/air@latest`

2. Install the recommended VS Code Workspace extensions

## Structure

Each folder is an experiment.  No references between experiments.

Remember to run commands from the root of the experiment folder.

## Some useful things I have learned

### go cli

*  `go env` to print the Go environment information.
* `go help <command>` to learn about a command
