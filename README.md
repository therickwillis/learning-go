# learning-go

This repo contains learning experiments in Go. 


## Requirements

For a good time:

1. Install Air

    `go install github.com/air-verse/air@latest`

2. Install the recommended VS Code Workspace extensions

## Structure

Each folder is an experiment.  No references between experiments.

## Some useful things I have learned

### go cli

*  `go env` to print the Go environment information
